        <h3> <p>Welcome to the White House, everybody. As I have already delivered my farewell address, I will try to be relatively brief. But I just wanted to get some folks together to pay tribute to somebody who’s not only been by my side for the duration of this amazing journey. But somebody who has devoted his entire professional life to service to this country. The best vice president America’s ever had, Mr. Joe Biden.This has been quite a ride. It was eight and a half years ago that I chose Joe to be my vice president. There has not been a single moment since that time that I have doubted the wisdom of that decision. It was the best possible choice, not just for me but for the American people. This is an extraordinary man, with an extraordinary career in public service. This is somebody the people of Delaware sent to the Senate as quickly as they possibly could."-Obama" </p> </h3>
        <h4> <p> "Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In a career of public service spanning nearly half a century, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has left his mark on almost every part of our nation fighting for a stronger middle class, a fairer judicial system, and a smarter foreign policy, providing unyielding support for our troops, combating crime and violence against women, leading our quest to cure cancer, and safeguarding the landmark American Recovery and Reinvestment Act from corruption.
        With his charm, candor, unabashed optimism and deep and abiding patriotism, Joe Biden has garnered the respect and esteem of colleagues of both parties and the friendship of people across the nation and around the world. While summoning the strength, faith, and grace to overcome great personal tragedy, this son of Scranton, Claymont and Wilmington has become one of the most consequential vice presidents in American history, an accolade that none the less rests firmly behind his legacy as husband, father, and grandfather.
        A grateful nation thanks Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for his lifetime of service on behalf of the United States of America."</p></h4>
